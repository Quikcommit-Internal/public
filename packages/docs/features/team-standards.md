# Team Standards

Teams can enforce shared commit rules across the organization.

## Team Rules

Org admins set rules (scopes, types, header length) that apply to all members. When you run `qc`, team rules are merged with your local commitlint config.

## Setup

Requires a Team or Scale plan. Invite members with:

```bash
qc team invite user@example.com
```
